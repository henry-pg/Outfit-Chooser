Here is a fun little project that generates some apparel suggestions based
on the weather at your location!I made this using the OpeanWeather API and 
the OpenAI API.

In order to try this web app out, you must make your own API keys with 
OpenWeather API and OpenAI API and store them in a config file in the same 
respository as this project.
